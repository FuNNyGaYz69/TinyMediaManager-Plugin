<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

Make sure you set the NFO format for your media player under movies, NFO settings. Make any other changes to settings as desired and exit settings.
- Add the folders that contain your associated adult media as a data source and update sources. 
- Select a video from the list of files in the listbox
- Right click the video and select search and scrape
- A dialogue box will pop up showing you the search results. You can modify the search parameters until you get the desired results.
- Selecting OK will commit the results and write your NFO file/save a local poster

> For a successful match to your Scenes, filenames should be in the format best recognized by the API. See the namer tool that is also part of this project.
